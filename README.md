## Python_Dice_Roller


### Assignment Description

The purpose of this assignment was to create a program that can automatically roll dice. The program also took user input to decide whether another dice should be rolled, or if the program should exit. The spicy version added complexity by asking the user to specify the number of sides on the dice and the number of dice to be rolled at a time. The user was then asked whether they wanted to roll again with the same settings, change the settings, or exit the program.

### Reflection

This assignment was relatively simple, but was challenging because I had not coded in Python for several months. I learned that I could import parts of toolboxes without importing the entire thing, but that changes the syntax of how I call the function later. I also learned about using a while loop to control whether a user wants to exit the program. For the spicy version, I needed to use nested loops. Python determines what is inside a loop by the indent level of each line of text, rather than brackets like some other coding styles. That means I need to be really careful with my tabs!


## Python_Calculator

### Assignment Description

The purpose of this assignment was creating a calculator that could return the sum, product, quotient, difference, modulus, and factorials of two numbers. The program takes an input for the two numbers and then runs those two numbers through all the different formulas.

### Reflection

I learned how to use google more effectively to research my problems. I also figured out a good process to work on these problems by taking them one step at a time without 
trying to immediately figure out exactly how the program will work


# Quadratic_Calculator

### Assignment Description

The purpose of this assignment was to create a calculator that could take input for 3 variables and solve the quadratic formula with those variables.

### Wiring

N/A

### Reflection

I used a lot of the same strategies in this program that I did in the calculator program. This program was much more involved as far as the amount of functions I needed goes, 
but the basic strategy of going one step at a time was the same.


# Strings and Loops

### Assignment Description

The purpose of this assignment was to create a program that could take a sentence and put each character on a new line. It can also replace the spaces with the dash symbol("-")

### Wiring

N/A

### Reflection

In this assignment the goal included making the code as short as possible. I first made a 6 or 7 line functioning program. I needed some help from google on this one because
I couldn't figure out how to replace items in a string, but I figured it out. Then I condensed the code by replacing variables with the actual value of those variables where I
used the variables.


# MSP

### Assignment Description

The purpose of this assignement was to create a hangman game that could be passed between two people.

### Wiring

### Reflection

In this assignment I ran into many problems, and I feel like I got a good grasp on how to ask efficient questions. I also got a lot better at reading through my code and understanding exactly what was happening. This helped me correct many problems with my code.


# Skateboard

### Assignment Description

This assignment asked me to replicate a swing arm part from a set of drawings. The assignment style is similar to a portion of the Onshape Associate Certification test.

### Reflection
The tutorial - although a little slow - was very helpful in teaching me new things to do in onshape that will make future projects go much faster.
